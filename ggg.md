## [CHAPTER 1: UNBOXING & SETUP]

**Transition to unboxing footage: Show clips of opening the packaging, removing parts, skimming through instructions, etc.**

**On-Camera/VO**:  
> The Flexispot E2 arrived well-packaged. Inside the box, I found all the necessary parts neatly organized:

> - A control box and handset  
> - All the screws, tools, and accessories needed  
> - And of course, the desktop itself (if you got the Flexispot desktop option).  

> The instructions were straightforward, and the entire setup took me about [insert your time] minutes. I recommend using a power drill if you have one, but everything can be done with the supplied Allen wrench. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully.

> 1. **Height Range**: It has a height range from [X to Y inches/cm (depending on the model)] – accommodating most users whether sitting or standing.  
> 2. **Motor & Speed**: The E2 features a single/dual motor system (depending on your exact E2 variant) that’s relatively quiet. I measured the noise level at around [insert approximate decibels if you did a test], which is pretty discreet.  
> 3. **Controller**: The control panel is simple. You press up or down to adjust the height, and some versions include memory presets so you can save your favorite sitting and standing heights.  
> 4. **Stability**: There’s minimal wobble at standing height, especially for a desk in this price range.  
> 5. **Weight Capacity**: The E2 can hold up to [insert approximate weight capacity], so whether you have a dual monitor setup or a heavy desktop tower, it should handle it well.
