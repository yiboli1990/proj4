Here’s a clear, concise draft for the footnote:

Footnote:
For Development Control and Model Control, metrics are calculated based on IR model scope with data as of May 16. For Inventory OM and Change Control, metrics reflect data as of the end of Q1 at the assessment level, not specifically scoped to TI models.




Detailed Transcript Summary

RTSA Results for IDDR Models
	•	Results were presented in a summarized table format, printed concisely onto one page.
	•	Metrics are based on a four-point scale defining thresholds clearly.
	•	Specific clarifications requested:
	•	Footnote required:
	•	Metrics for Development Control and Model Control based on IR model scope data as of May 16.
	•	Inventory OM and Change Control metrics calculated as of end of Q1 at the assessment (uter) level, not scoped specifically to TI models.
	•	The “IDDR” models discussed are a one-time ad hoc exercise for July; thus, additional detailed clarifications for these are unnecessary.
	•	Confirmation that ineffective remediation findings and excessive indicators should not be assumed as fully effective and should be excluded.

Table Ranking and Additional Analysis
	•	Current ranking in tables is based on the number of models.
	•	Received a request from Bill to rank Assessment Units (AUs) by “badness” (risk level).
	•	An additional table will address Bill’s specific request.
	•	The team agreed sorting by number of models is currently practical, pending Bill’s feedback.

Brian’s Update
	•	Progress ongoing; feedback gathering from various stakeholders continues.
	•	Recommendation given to simplify and make internal feedback notes less formal and more direct, highlighting essential actions clearly.
	•	Confirmed the recalibration of the threshold scale from a four-point to a three-point scale may be considered going forward, but verification is required on whether to show Q1 results again using the new scale to Brian, pending Bill’s decision.

Regulatory and Audience-specific Communications
	•	Acknowledgment that updates for Brian should differ significantly from broader audience updates.

	•	Capital model approval requests.
	•	Preparations for the 2025 examinations.

Next Steps
	•	Aim to finalize a clear and concise draft for Brian’s update by the following morning.





Please review and let me know if any adjustments are needed!




Here’s the simplified and refined summary:

AI Guardrail 3.0: MRM has approved the enhanced AI Guardrail 3.0 (Tier-1), enabling the GS AI Assistant to handle larger and multiple documents, supporting up to 500,000 tokens (~750 pages). Guardrails include both monitoring and preventative controls, applicable across the firmwide AI platform. A new feature is under development to indicate hallucinated content to users before enabling preventative blocking.

AI FX Algo Trading Signal: MRM approved a transformer-based AI model for the FX eDealing Client Pricing algorithm, enhancing the FX algorithmic market-making business. The model effectively predicts the direction of price movements for a basket of major FX currency pairs, demonstrating strong performance in high-frequency trading scenarios.




Sure, here’s a concise version in two sentences:

Assessment Units are ranked from worst to best based on the number of Ineffective ratings, followed by Adequately Effective ratings. If there is a tie, the unit with more models is ranked worse.

Certainly! Here’s a direct quote from the transcript you can include to reflect that addition clearly:

“We’ll also provide you with those MRCC materials once they’re finalized and after the meeting. So you can actually see the exact changes that we’re proposing.”

“We’re also happy to provide you with those examples once they’re ready. And we, of course, would welcome any feedback.”

You can incorporate this into your notes to explicitly document MRM’s offer to share both MRCC materials and annual review mock-up examples once available.



MRM offered to submit finalized MRCC materials following their review meeting, as well as detailed annual review mock-up examples once ready. These materials aim to clearly demonstrate the proposed changes and enhancements to the regulator, and feedback was specifically invited.






Does this structured summary meet your expectations, or would you like any refinements?

Meeting Minutes – Regulator Meeting

Invalidated and Rejected Models:
	•	Regulator inquired about unvalidated models in use and whether there were thematic issues.
	•	MRM responded:
	•	Tier 1 Models: Utilization is low, mainly due to significant model changes implemented before validation.
	•	Tier 2 Models: Primarily driven by GBM, AWM, and Controllers. Controllers’ issues relate to capital add-on calculations for EMEA legal entities.
	•	Tier 3 Models: Utilization relatively low.
	•	Regulator asked about rejected models.
	•	MRM explained rejections were due to regression testing failures exceeding 14 days, triggering model rejections and escalations, which have since been resolved.

Threshold Breaches (Page 10):
	•	Regulator inquired about breaches related to invalidated Tier 2 models aged over six months and Tier 1 models with findings aged over nine months.
	•	MRM responded:
	•	Tier 2: Breaches related to capital add-on calculations delays, with one resolved and two expected to be approved shortly.
	•	Tier 1: Issues were primarily in the counterparty credit risk area (margin shortfall calculations) with significant management attention and ongoing remediation efforts.

Generative AI (Gen AI) Usage:
	•	Regulator asked about increased usage and governance of generative AI models.
	•	MRM explained proactive steps initiated in 2023, establishing firm-wide AI governance and the AI Risk and Controls Committee. Growth has been gradual, focusing on low-risk productivity-enhancing tools.
	•	MRM highlighted two Tier 1 AI models: one for AI platform monitoring (guardrail model), and one related to ESG metrics.
	•	Regulator asked about committee composition and risk coverage.
	•	MRM explained committee membership includes stakeholders from Legal, Compliance, Operational Risk, Tech Risk, Engineering, and MRM, ensuring comprehensive risk review and monitoring of all AI use cases.

MRA Remediation Progress:
	•	Regulator requested an update on MRA remediation.
	•	MRM provided an overview:
	•	Completed first milestone (enhanced annual review templates) with external consultant input.
	•	Scheduled to review enhancements with MRCC.
	•	Created differentiated templates for Tiers 1-3 and Tier 4 models, enhanced question structure and guidance, requiring detailed commentary for all questions.
	•	Proposed exemption from annual reviews in revalidation years, aligning with industry practice.
	•	Next steps include system enhancements and team-wide training, starting with mock reviews.

Tier 4 Model Reviews:
	•	Regulator asked about newly introduced Tier 4 models (low-risk AI/ML models).
	•	MRM explained:
	•	Tier 4 specifically addresses low-risk AI/ML models recently included in inventory.
	•	Annual reviews focus on ongoing monitoring and maintaining low risk, elevating tier and review rigor as necessary.

Conclusion:
	•	Regulator acknowledged remediation progress, expressing satisfaction with proposed enhancements.
	•	MRM committed to providing further documentation (examples, MRCC materials) and remaining available for additional meetings.
	•	Regulator agreed to have additional internal review by David Palmer for final feedback.




Key Guardrail 3.0 Improvements:
	•	Better hallucination detection, including subtle cases.
	•	Improved processing of longer documents.
	•	Upgraded LLM to Gemini Flash 2.0.
	•	Clearly separated Prompt Injection detection from PII/Harmful content detection.
	•	Expanded proprietary dataset for improved fine-tuning.




220 models underwent additional validation or revalidation in Q1, primarily driven by:
	•	The annual review process, notably including (1) implementation of the multi-risk-factor stress methodology for the credit risk scenario design model, (2) enhancements to risk factors and applicable markets for the investment decision model used for interest rate swaps across markets, (3) improvements to equity volatility risk models ensuring consistent proxy granularity and refining the volatility surface shock methodology, and (4) enhancements related to the Interest Rate Risk (IRR) model, including backtesting improvements.
	•	Insufficient documentation, testing, and ongoing monitoring.

						•	A loss of $121k occurred due to incorrect market data used by an automated trading system for equity risk management in Japan.
	•	The issue was caused by a system failure; the error was manually corrected by a trader, as existing controls didn’t detect this specific scenario.
	•	New automated controls have been implemented to prevent similar incidents, with additional risk assessment planned.



https://www.atlassian.com/data/charts/stacked-bar-chart-complete-guide

“One important consideration in building a stacked bar chart is to decide which of the two categorical variables will be the primary variable (dictating major axis positions and overall bar lengths) and which will be the secondary (dictating how each primary bar will be subdivided). The most ‘important’ variable should be the primary; use domain knowledge and the specific type of categorical variables to make a decision on how to assign your categorical variables.”

In your case:

Model Tier reflects hierarchy or domain importance (Tier 1–4), and likely drives the structure of validation efforts.

Validation Outcome is a dependent result of the process.

Therefore, the guidance suggests that Model Tier is the more appropriate variable for the x-axis (primary category), while Outcome is suited for stacking (secondary category).

Also relevant is:

“Variables with more levels are generally better as primary variables; we want to limit the number of secondary levels to a fairly small amount to make the stack breakdowns easier to read.”

Since your Model Tier variable has 4 levels and Outcome has 2, the document supports placing Model Tier on the x-axis, with Outcome as the stacked segments.

Let me know if you'd like a one-page summary or visual aid referencing this guidance.




That’s a very good question — and it touches on an important nuance in data visualization: chart titles describe what is being measured, but not necessarily how the data must be structured.

📌 Key Consideration: What is the primary comparison you want to show?
Let’s break it down:

🟦 Chart Title: "Model Validation Outcomes"
This tells the viewer what the chart is about — i.e., the result of the validation process — but it doesn’t dictate whether outcomes or tiers belong on the x-axis. That decision depends on what dimension you want to compare across:

Option 1: X-axis = Model Tiers
Interpretation: “Here’s how outcomes (Approved/Rejected) differ across model tiers.”

Viewer takeaway: Outcome patterns by tier

Typical for internal model inventory reviews or governance presentations

✅ Recommended when your goal is:

"How do validation outcomes vary across different tiers?"

Option 2: X-axis = Outcomes
Interpretation: “Here’s how the number of models from each tier contributes to each outcome.”

Viewer takeaway: Tier contribution within each outcome

Less common unless focused on categorizing models by outcome

✅ Valid when your goal is:

"What tiers are most represented in Approved vs. Rejected categories?"

🧠 Visualization Practice Consensus
Most data visualization guidelines (e.g., from Atlassian, Storytelling with Data, and Datawrapper) emphasize that:

The x-axis should represent the categorical variable you're comparing (e.g., Tiers)

The stacks or bars should reflect composition or outcome breakdown

So even though the chart is named “Model Validation Outcomes,” that does not mean the x-axis must be “Outcomes.”



Here’s a cleaner and more polished version of your sentence:

There is continued growth in the development of generative AI models, including the recent approval of enhancements to the model serving as a monitoring framework for the GS AI Platform, designed to detect potential unsafe conversations between users and a large language model (LLM) (e.g., hallucination, profanity, prompt injection, personally identifiable information), and now extended to enable real-time hallucination blocking, shifting its role from monitoring to preventative control.

Would you also like an even slightly more concise option?





Issue-Management Talking Points
	•	Clarify the remit
	•	Issues Management (IM) is a first-line tool to record and remediate model-performance or control gaps; Model Risk remains a facilitator, not the owner.
	•	Avoid “model-risk cutting” perceptions by keeping ownership with Liquidity/Res Engineering, Finance Risk, etc.
	•	Current coverage & pain points
	•	IDDR AUs: controls stand-up targeted for end-Q2 2025; firm-wide by year-end 2025.
	•	Controls not yet embedded ⇒ IM metrics red-flag many items that are actually implementation lag, not true defects.
	•	Overdue inventory (Apr-29-2025 cut): GBM 156 / Risk 90 models (~10–12 % of their inventories) driving the red status.
	•	Metrics & thresholds
	•	Draft severity thresholds (count & aging) complete; ready for production once controls are live.
	•	Proposal: announce a go-live date now (e.g., 1 Oct 2025) and a grace period during which AUs must clear or formally waive aged items.
	•	Escalation path
	•	Models breaching thresholds auto-generate High-Severity findings with predefined remediation milestones.
	•	Mid-May Controller CVA waiver is a test-case: if timeline slips, AU must table a revised plan immediately.
	•	Regulatory & audit backdrop
	•	Fed exam teams already probing link between ER tracker and IM; mixed vocabulary is causing confusion.
	•	Internal Audit likely to raise a finding if systematic IM isn’t demonstrated in 2H 2025.
	•	Actions for Brian
	1.	Endorse the proposed go-live date and grace-period message.
	2.	Signal to AU heads that overdue backlogs will trigger automatic High-Severity findings post–go-live.
	3.	Support resource allocation to the two heaviest offenders (Market-Risk Strats & Risk-Economic Strats) to reduce red items before Q4.




Executive-level take-away

Brian’s next update needs to knit together three threads: (1) growing regulatory/exam pressure around model performance vs. model‐control governance, (2) near-term deliverables and deadlines across validation, waivers, and AI governance, and (3) the emerging need to escalate overdue models and findings through a more systematic issues-management playbook.  The talking points below are ordered the way the team suggested presenting them to Brian.

⸻

1. Exam response & “IRR/IDDR confusion”
	•	Clarify the purpose of the Liquidity-Risk/Engineering tracker – it is first-line performance monitoring, not a Model Control Policy artefact.
	•	Stress that Model Risk is coordinating but must not become the de-facto owner of exam findings; ownership stays with first line.
	•	Flag risk of leaving the exam with an unintended “model-risk cutting” finding; action: align vocabulary and responsibilities before the next Fed touchpoint.

2. Model-Control & RCSA roll-out
	•	Status by division
	•	IDDR AUs fully stood-up target → end-Q2 2025
	•	Firm-wide roll-out target → end-2025
	•	Show-and-tell for Brian
	•	One-pager matrix: all Risk AUs with their Model-Risk controls, RCSA mapping, primary/secondary sign-offs.
	•	If possible, a parallel view for Controllers (IPV vs. RevCap split still under discussion).
	•	Note GBM–Model-Control meeting likely to move forward (check new date).

3. Personnel / capacity
	•	Introduce Emma (May intake) now assisting the team.

4. AI / Generative-model governance
	•	MRM AI Assistant pilot and related regulatory threads – bundle under one bullet.
	•	VerCopilot (S-1 generation) status; highlight AWS-Hosting & Engineering pushback (WM driven).
	•	Two weeks until FID-T Explainability & Data-Science submission → offline working session to finalise, then release to Compliance.

5. Validation pipeline & “Lotus” deadlines
	•	US vs. PRA divergence
	•	US models will stick to 2025 Lotus timeline; PRA path still undecided but will likely rely on current QAs/manual processes in the interim.
	•	Provide Brian any colour on feasibility of running parallel rating methodologies.
	•	Early validation themes – data representativeness, conceptual soundness (e.g., Antonas Ray conceptual issue).

6. CCAR & firm-wide stress metrics
	•	New Firm-Wide Asset Loss Metric (extension of un-margined metric) moving from exposure to loss basis.
	•	Validation working to reconcile weak- vs. six-month shocks; need written methodology.
	•	Confirm June deliverables and any further phases for Canal and related projects.

7. Controller CVA waivers (critical path)
	•	Mid-May target at risk; Controllers still refining justification language.
	•	Action for Controllers: if the date will slip, surface a revised plan immediately with root-cause detail.
	•	Escalate to Brian that this waiver is closely tracked by Zero Committee.

8. Inventory, metrics & issues-management escalation

Area	Total models	Overdue / waiver	%
GBM (all)	~1,500	156	≈10%
Risk	~750	90	≈12%

	•	Most overdue Risk models sit in Market-Risk Strats & Risk-Economic Strats AUs.
	•	Proposed next steps
	1.	Finalise severity thresholds (already drafted) and set a go-live date for systematic raising in Issues Management.
	2.	Communicate grace period end to AU owners; remediation playbooks ready.
	3.	Prepare for potential Internal Audit scrutiny if delays persist.

9. Miscellaneous regulatory items (one-line bullets)
	•	ILST methodology updates – ready to brief.
	•	SEC NPR (new market-risk rules) – no immediate action for Model Risk; monitor.
	•	FIS code exam wrap-up – largely handled by MRM; worth a closing remark.
	•	ETSC findings – four on-track for June closure; credit-mark negotiation completed.

⸻

Suggested deck structure for Brian
	1.	Exam & Ownership Clarification (slide)
	2.	Model-Control / RCSA Map – Risk & Controllers (tables)
	3.	Key Deliverables Calendar (timeline graphic)
	4.	AI Governance Snapshot (bullet slide)
	5.	Validation & Lotus Status (narrative + heat-map)
	6.	Waivers & Overdue Models – Metrics & Next Steps (chart)
	7.	Regulatory Odds-and-Ends (overflow slide)

This coverage should equip Brian to answer likely questions on governance scope, upcoming deadlines, and the plan to impose more disciplined issue escalation.








Got it — keeping your original start (“new model for pricing callable credit-linked notes (CLNs),”), here’s the improved version:

New model for pricing callable credit-linked notes (CLNs), using dynamics that incorporate both stochastic hazard rates and stochastic interest rates, addressing the limitations of existing approved models that assume deterministic hazard rates.

Would you also like an even slightly smoother version with minimal change, like adding just one word to make it read even more naturally (e.g., “has been introduced”)?



Implementation Requirements by Phase:

The initial implementation of the Deterministic Regulatory Calculation (DRC) framework for the calculation of U.S. Standardized Approach Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), addressing direct regulatory feedback, must comply fully with all requirements specified in this Policy.

Any subsequent extension of this framework to include calculations related to the Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) surcharge and the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), as part of the firm's Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) enhancement initiatives, must also fully comply with all requirements outlined in this Policy.

A detailed plan for the remaining implementation activities concerning U.S. regulatory capital ratios under the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based and leverage capital regulations will be provided during the Policy's annual review. This plan will include clearly defined timeframes within which the DRC implementation will achieve full compliance with this Policy.



Thank you — that’s a very important clarification.
You’re saying the issue isn’t traders randomly picking marks, it’s that there’s no reliable market price available for them to mark to.
This needs to be worded carefully to reflect that.

Here’s the revised version staying very close to your structure with “and”, now properly reflecting mark-to-market difficulties:

⸻

Volatility and correlation calibration issues were observed in multi-cross FX trades due to increased volatility and skew, and challenges in sourcing reliable market prices for marking; a temporary solution with limited impact has been approved, and further investigation is in progress.

⸻

Another polished version, a little more formal but still matching your original structure:

Volatility and correlation calibration issues were observed in multi-cross FX trades due to increased volatility and skew, and difficulty identifying reliable market levels for marking; a temporary solution with limited impact has been approved, and further investigation is in progress.

⸻

Small but important details fixed:
	•	“Challenges in sourcing reliable market prices for marking” = focuses exactly on mark-to-market.
	•	“Difficulty identifying reliable market levels” = another variation if you want slightly more formal tone.
	•	Preserved your “and”, your structure, your meaning, without making it sound alarming (“unreliable market data” sounded bad — now it’s more professional).

⸻

Would you like me to also show a super crisp version for an executive deck or slide, if you want an even sharper cut?
(Only if you need.)





Got it — you want a version that defines not just AMC, but also CM, MC, SFL, etc.
Here’s a much clearer rewrite where I lightly define the acronyms in-line:

⸻

Efficiency and strategic risk architecture initiatives, including recent approval of enhancements to the American Monte Carlo (AMC) regression framework — a simulation-based approach for valuing options with early exercise features — to improve the numerical implementation for credit products, particularly for Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of credit multi-coupon (multi-CM) payoffs used across Strategic Financing Lending (SFL) businesses, including public and private transactions and exotics, with future plans to extend usage to other asset classes such as CVA tradables, as part of a broader optimization effort.

⸻

Summary of what I did:
	•	AMC → American Monte Carlo (simulation-based approach for early exercise options)
	•	MC → Monte Carlo (simulation method)
	•	multi-CM → multi-coupon (multi-CM) payoffs
	•	SFL → Strategic Financing Lending (SFL)

Quick check:
	•	AMC = American Monte Carlo = simulation approach used when valuing American-style options (early exercise possible)
	•	MC = Monte Carlo simulation = random sampling to simulate price paths
	•	CM = multi-coupon structures = multiple cash flows/payoffs at different times
	•	SFL = Strategic Financing and Lending = business segment handling specialized financing (including public/private side)

⸻

Would you also like a version that’s even a little shorter, in case you need to make it even more compact?
(Depends if you’re writing for a deck, email, or formal memo.)




Got it — keeping your structure and phrasing for the first part exactly, and fitting everything into one clean sentence, here’s the improved version:

Enhancements to the approach for adjusting barrier levels (“barrier shift”) used for pricing multi-asset equity autocallables to be dynamically updated based on volatility versus the previous approach of determining the adjustments at the time of the trade, while also capturing the additional Vega introduced by applying a cap and floor to volatility-based shifts that was previously not reflected in trader-marked values.

⸻

Would you like a second version that’s slightly more formal (just in case you need it for a very polished memo)?



Model Risk has approved the change to re-mark US Volex’s USD YCRA book, restoring the pre-December 2022 MEE-window pricing methodology used for other callables after validating the supporting code update.

In the transcript, the acknowledgment letter comes up when the Federal Reserve representative confirms that they have received and reviewed the firm’s recent project plan/response and notes that an official acknowledgment letter will be sent soon. Here’s the relevant excerpt in context:

	Regulator (Fed): “We did … and I was able to review those and also I wanted to let the firm know that we did render the process of reviewing the response. So … we should be sending acknowledgment letters soon—just wanted to let you know that.”

The key points regarding the acknowledgment letter are:
	1.	Purpose: It is a formal notification from the Fed acknowledging receipt and initial review of the firm’s submission (such as a supervisory response or project plan).
	2.	Timing: The Fed representative explains that the letter will go out “soon” but does not specify an exact date.
	3.	Next Steps: The letter generally confirms that regulators have reviewed the material and outlines whether there will be any follow-up questions or additional steps expected from the firm.

So, in short, the acknowledgment letter is the official communication from the Fed that they have received the firm’s materials and are moving forward with their supervisory review process.





Below is a concise “Q&A style” summary of the data quality discussion that took place during the transcript, highlighting the question from the regulator and the response from the firm’s Model Risk Management (MRM) team.

⸻

1. Regulator’s Question on Data Quality
	1.	Context of the Inquiry
	•	The regulator observed mentions of data quality issues in the revalidation process and asked how the firm is addressing data governance—particularly as it expands into Generative AI (GAI).
	2.	Core Question
	•	“How is the firm thinking about data quality issues, especially around Generative AI? Are there new or enhanced data management and governance frameworks in place to handle the heightened data risk from advanced AI models?”

⸻

2. Firm’s Response on Data Quality
	1.	Enterprise Data Governance Uplifts
	•	The firm noted that it is already engaged in enterprise-wide data governance enhancements, partly tied to broader regulatory expectations (e.g., BCBS 239 or internal “EMF uplift” efforts).
	•	These ongoing programs aim to improve data lineage, data quality controls, and overall consistency of data usage across the firm.
	2.	Model Risk Perspective
	•	From an MRM viewpoint, data validation is already a core requirement. The firm emphasized that it verifies not only the input data but also the accuracy of the “ground truth” or reference data used to train or benchmark models.
	•	Particularly for AI/ML models, validators focus on how raw inputs are processed into features and whether the labeled outcomes (ground truth) are reliable.
	3.	Generative AI-Specific Measures
	•	Generative AI models must follow the same model validation framework, but with additional scrutiny around:
	•	Data provenance: Where the training data or reference data is coming from.
	•	Comparison across AI engines: For instance, using two different Large Language Model (LLM) providers to cross-check results for consistency or potential drift.
	•	The firm’s newly formed AI Risk & Controls Committee adds supplemental reviews of data usage, model outputs, and risk to ensure that these models comply with legal, compliance, and privacy standards.
	4.	Real-World Example
	•	For the ESGAI model (the first Tier 1 “generative AI” model at the firm), MRM paid close attention to:
	•	Data labeled by humans: Ensuring labels or reference data were validated.
	•	Potential mismatch among multiple AI engines: Identifying if different LLMs yield divergent outputs, which might point to data or labeling inconsistencies.
	5.	Ongoing Controls and Monitoring
	•	Daily or frequent performance tests ensure that if data streams degrade or become inconsistent, the model’s performance metrics will flag it.
	•	The firm also proactively watches for unexpected code changes—a spike in urgent code fixes may signal data or model under “pressure” that warrants closer review.

⸻

Final Takeaway
	•	The regulator asked how the firm is managing data quality—especially in the Generative AI realm.
	•	The firm explained that it has robust data governance efforts in progress, validates ground truth and feature processing for AI/ML, and employs ongoing monitoring plus a specialized AI Risk & Controls Committee to address new challenges posed by advanced models. The focus is on ensuring reliable inputs and consistent labeling so that AI and other models remain accurate, even under heightened market or operational “pressure.”




What “Pressure” Means in This Setting
	1.	Market Volatility or Stress Events
	•	Large swings in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or credit spreads can introduce unexpected behaviors in a model’s inputs or outputs.
	•	Sudden shocks can reveal gaps in model assumptions or calibration.
	2.	Model Performance & Stability
	•	Models under “pressure” may exhibit higher-than-expected errors, fail certain back-tests, or produce outputs that do not align with market observations.
	•	In risk management terms, a model might be at risk of “breaking” (e.g., generating unrealistic valuations or risk measures) when real-world conditions deviate sharply from the historical data it relies on.
	3.	Operational or Business Changes
	•	Rapidly evolving products, new lines of business, or emergency trading strategies can stress a model if it has not been recalibrated for those changes.

⸻

2. How the Firm Monitors Models Under Pressure

When asked about recent market and interest-rate volatility, the firm’s representatives explained:
	1.	Daily Risk Testing
	•	Many of the front-office and risk models (e.g., pricing, Value-at-Risk, counterparty exposure) undergo daily “re-tests” or real-time performance checks.
	•	If unusual outputs or back-test exceptions surface, those prompt immediate investigation.
	2.	Code Change Monitoring
	•	A sudden increase in developer “hot fixes” or emergency code changes can be a red flag. It might indicate a model is struggling under current market conditions.
	•	The Model Risk Management (MRM) team watches for spikes in code deployments as an early-warning sign.
	3.	Enhanced Scrutiny During Events
	•	If global markets experience a big shock (e.g., a large interest-rate jump or extreme volatility), MRM and the business lines perform ad hoc or forward-looking scenario analyses.
	•	They compare model outputs to alternative benchmarks or “ground truth” data to see if performance is degrading.
	4.	Regular Governance Touchpoints
	•	Any sign of model underperformance triggers Model Risk Control Committee or FRAC reviews. If severe, it escalates to the Board Risk Committee.

⸻

3. Current Observations

From the transcript, the firm indicated:
	•	They have not identified any major breakdowns or anomalies despite recent rate and FX fluctuations.
	•	Ongoing monitoring has not revealed big spikes in back-test exceptions or model failures, so no immediate “pressure” issues were flagged at the time of that conversation.

⸻

4. Why This Matters
	1.	Preemptive Risk Management
	•	By actively searching for “pressure points,” the firm can adjust models (e.g., recalibrate, update assumptions) before problems become critical.
	2.	Regulatory Expectations
	•	Regulators expect that banks detect early signs of model stress and proactively mitigate. If the firm fails to do so, it might face supervisory findings or require urgent remediation.
	3.	Business Continuity and Accuracy
	•	Accurate models under all market conditions reduce the risk of trading losses, mispriced products, and poor strategic decisions.

⸻

Final Takeaway

“Pressure” refers to the stresses placed on a model by volatile or unexpected market conditions. The firm’s process—daily testing, code-change monitoring, ongoing validation checks, and escalations to senior committees—aims to catch any emergent model issues promptly. As of the conversation in the transcript, no significant “pressure” had manifested in the firm’s models, but they continue enhanced 



In the context of the transcript, “pressure” primarily refers to external market or business conditions that could stress or challenge the firm’s models—especially when there is heightened market volatility or significant economic shifts.

	4.	Regular Governance Touchpoints
	•	Any sign of model underperformance triggers Model Risk Control Committee or FRAC reviews. If severe, it escalates to the Board Risk Committee.

⸻

3. Current Observations

From the transcript, the firm indicated:
	•	They have not identified any major breakdowns or anomalies despite recent rate and FX fluctuations.
	•	Ongoing monitoring has not revealed big spikes in back-test exceptions or model failures, so no immediate “pressure” issues were flagged at the time of that conversation.

⸻

4. Why This Matters
	1.	Preemptive Risk Management
	•	By actively searching for “pressure points,” the firm can adjust models (e.g., recalibrate, update assumptions) before problems become critical.
	2.	Regulatory Expectations
	•	Regulators expect that banks detect early signs of model stress and proactively mitigate. If the firm fails to do so, it might face supervisory findings or require urgent remediation.
	3.	Business Continuity and Accuracy
	•	Accurate models under all market conditions reduce the risk of trading losses, mispriced products, and poor strategic decisions.

⸻

Final Takeaway

“Pressure” refers to the stresses placed on a model by volatile or unexpected market conditions. The firm’s process—daily testing, code-change monitoring, ongoing validation checks, and escalations to senior committees—aims to catch any emergent model issues promptly. As of the conversation in the transcript, no significant “pressure” had manifested in the firm’s models, but they continue enhanced scrutiny as part of standard risk oversight.




Below is an expanded explanation of how granular the reporting is—particularly what information the firm’s Board Risk Committee (BRC), the Firmwide Risk & Controls Committee (FRAC), and other senior groups see with respect to model risk.

⸻

1. Board-Level Reporting
	1.	High-Level Risk Appetite Metrics
	•	The Board primarily sees aggregate Model Risk metrics—these are the same top-level Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) that form part of the firm’s Risk Appetite Statement (RAS).
	•	Examples include the number of unvalidated or rejected Tier 1 models in use, breaches of model risk thresholds (e.g., how many models have been “aged” past one year), and any zero-tolerance threshold violations.
	2.	Model Inventory Overview
	•	The Board is given a snapshot of the total number of models, categorized by business unit (Risk, GBM, etc.) and by approval status (validated, unvalidated, rejected).
	•	This helps them gauge the overall size and complexity of the firm’s modeling landscape.
	3.	Significant Updates and Thematic Issues
	•	For important emerging topics—like Generative AI, stress-testing enhancements, or high-profile regulatory findings—the Board receives summary updates or short thematic discussions.
	•	These overviews give them a sense of why certain issues are arising, where potential risks are concentrated, and how management is remediating them.
	4.	Escalation of Major Problems
	•	Any “high-severity” or Tier 1 model concerns (e.g., a large breach or a critical supervisory finding) is escalated immediately to the Board.
	•	If a threshold is breached at the Board level—for instance, if a model’s unvalidated status goes beyond one year—this is highlighted in the Board materials as a zero-tolerance breach.

	Key Takeaway: The Board sees top-level model risk metrics, major trends, and serious exceptions. They do not typically see the full granular “line-by-line” detail for every finding or model.

⸻

2. FRAC and Model Risk Control Committee Reporting
	1.	More Detailed Breakdowns
	•	The FRAC and Model Risk Control Committee (MRCC) get the same top-level metrics the Board sees, plus more granular reporting.
	•	For instance, they might see a breakdown of the exact number of findings by severity, open vs. closed status, and how many days past due each item is.
	2.	Qualitative Approaches, Deterministic Reg Calculations
	•	Beyond typical quantitative models, these committees also see detailed metrics on qualitative approaches and deterministic regulatory calculations (such as certain capital or compliance calculations).
	•	This ensures coverage of all tool types under the broader “model” or “model-like” umbrella.
	3.	In-Depth Thematic Reviews
	•	If there is a specific area of heightened focus—e.g., new large language models, a revalidation wave for stress-testing, or interest-rate volatility—FRAC/MRCC may receive a deeper “spotlight” analysis or a short write-up showing key observations and any open issues.
	4.	Focus on Remediation and Progress
	•	These committees track whether open findings are being closed on schedule and monitor areas with higher volumes of new findings.
	•	They also see trend analyses (e.g., quarter-over-quarter changes in the number of open findings, average days to close a finding, etc.).

⸻

3. Subcommittees and Working Groups
	•	Working-Level Detail
	•	At the most granular level—within MRM or specialized working groups—teams might review the individual findings line by line. This includes severity scores, root causes, and exact remediation steps.
	•	These working groups feed summarized information up to FRAC and eventually to the Board, so the level of detail filters appropriately based on the audience.

⸻

4. Why Different Audiences See Different Levels of Detail
	1.	Audience and Purpose
	•	Board: Oversees risk at a strategic level. They want to know if there are large or systemic issues jeopardizing the firm’s risk appetite.
	•	FRAC/MRCC: Operate at a more tactical and operational level, ensuring robust controls are actually implemented and that meaningful issues or rising trends are handled before they become Board-level breaches.
	•	Working Groups / Validation Teams: Perform the day-to-day analysis, root cause identification, model reviews, and produce the raw data that rolls up to the committees.
	2.	Escalation Tiers
	•	The firm’s governance model sets out which types of issues must be escalated to which committee—and on what timetable—to prevent any critical or overdue items from going unnoticed.

⸻

Final Summary
	•	The Board receives a high-level, strategic view: key metrics, risk appetite thresholds, serious exceptions, and thematic summaries.
	•	The FRAC/Model Risk Control Committee sees a more detailed breakdown of open findings, model statuses, business-line splits, and thematic deep-dives.
	•	Working groups handle the most granular, line-by-line model details, feeding that information upward as summarized reports for senior stakeholders.

In essence, the reporting grows more granular as you move from the Board (highest level) down to the committees and working groups.




In the transcript, there is a reference to six Tier 1 unvalidated models “quarter over quarter.” The concern was whether these six were the same models staying unvalidated too long or if the number “6” simply reappeared each quarter for different reasons (new models, model updates, etc.).

Key Points
	1.	It is not necessarily the same six models
	•	During the quarter, some Tier 1 models get validated and come off the unvalidated list, while new or changed models are added to the unvalidated list. So the figure may remain around six each quarter, but it reflects different models over time.
	2.	New Model Development & Significant Model Changes
	•	Tier 1 models often arise from highly complex or critical areas (e.g., trading, risk management). Whenever the firm introduces new Tier 1 models or makes material changes to existing ones, those models must go through revalidation.
	•	That revalidation process can temporarily increase the number of unvalidated Tier 1 models.
	3.	Waiver & Aging Controls
	•	The firm uses a 90-day waiver for unvalidated models in use, plus tight aging metrics (six or nine months at the FRAC level, one year at the Board level). These thresholds ensure that unvalidated models cannot remain outstanding indefinitely.
	•	If any model is in use without validation past its original remediation date, the firm tracks it as an “aged” item, which triggers increased scrutiny.
	4.	Ongoing ‘Churn’
	•	The firm describes a “churn” or turnover: some Tier 1 unvalidated models in use resolve each quarter and drop off the list, while new ones (due to fresh development or updates) come on. That can keep the number around six, even though they are not the same exact six from quarter to quarter.

⸻

In short, the number “six” showing up quarter over quarter does not imply that the same six Tier 1 models are perpetually unvalidated; rather, it’s a recurring level driven by ongoing model development, enhancements, and validation turnover.




From the discussion, the main reason for the uptick in findings near the end of the year is that new model development, model changes, and scheduled revalidations all came together in Q4. In other words:
	1.	New or Enhanced Models
	•	Whenever the firm introduces a new model or significantly changes an existing one, the Model Risk team performs fresh validation. This typically leads to new findings being raised.
	2.	Revalidations
	•	A large batch of Tier 1 model revalidations was wrapped up at year-end. These reviews can also generate findings—especially around documentation, calibration details, or minor code fixes—even when the model itself is fundamentally sound.
	3.	Close-Out vs. New Findings
	•	In Q4, the number of new findings (from all the model changes and revalidations) slightly outpaced the number of closed findings, causing a net increase (or “uptick”) in open items for that quarter.




Below is a structured, detailed summary of the discussion, based on the transcript provided. The conversation is primarily between representatives from a financial institution’s Model Risk Management (MRM) group (including Caroline, Bill, Bo, Bingwen, OJ, and others) and regulators from the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) and FDIC (with Michaela and Caleb representing the regulators). The main topics include quarterly model risk updates, threshold tightening for certain metrics, the use of generative AI models, and the status of various validation activities and findings.

⸻

1. Meeting Logistics and Introductions
	•	The call begins with attendees confirming who is present from both the firm and the regulators.
	•	Michaela joins, and the group confirms they have the relevant participants from the Fed, FDIC, and the bank’s MRM team.
	•	The bank’s team mentions that it sent over meeting materials in advance, confirming that the Fed received and reviewed them.

⸻

2. Recent Submissions and Regulatory Review
	•	The Fed acknowledges receipt of the firm’s recent project plan/response to supervisory requests and indicates that an acknowledgment letter will be sent soon.
	•	The firm reiterates it is available to address any questions about the plan or any other materials, either during the meeting or offline.

⸻

3. Updates on Risk Appetite Thresholds and Governance
	•	Tightening of waiver aging thresholds:
	•	The firm explains that it previously established a threshold of nine months for certain model waivers at the FRAC (Firmwide Risk and Controls Committee) level but decided to reduce it to six months.
	•	The Board Risk Committee (BRC) retains a one-year zero-tolerance threshold for these same items, meaning if a waiver is still unresolved after one year (relative to its original due date), it breaches the BRC’s risk appetite.
	•	The shortened six-month threshold provides an earlier escalation path while leaving a three-month buffer before hitting the Board-level one-year limit.

⸻

4. Discussion on Generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models
	•	A regulator inquires about a recently approved ESG-related large language model (an “ESGAI” model) and the firm’s broader generative AI strategy.
	•	AI governance structure:
	•	The bank has a dedicated AI policy and an AI Risk & Controls Committee, formed in 2023.
	•	The committee includes representatives from various control functions (Model Risk, Operational Risk, Legal, Compliance, etc.) to address potential risks of new AI use cases.
	•	Model Risk Management approach:
	•	Generative AI models are subject to the same core model-risk controls and require model validations similar to traditional models.
	•	The firm uses specialized documentation and validation templates for AI/ML models.
	•	They have introduced a separate AI inventory process so that not only validated AI models but also certain AI “tools” and “platforms” are tracked.
	•	Use cases and outlook:
	•	Most generative AI models so far are in lower-risk, operational efficiency use cases.
	•	The ESGAI model is the first “Tier 1” generative AI model (i.e., of higher materiality/risk) that has gone through full validation.
	•	Additional generative AI expansions are expected, but each is examined under the AI policy and standard model risk controls.

⸻

5. Status of Validation Findings and Internal Audit (IA) Items
	•	Open and closed findings:
	•	The MRM team reviews charts illustrating open findings, newly raised findings, and those closed during the quarter.
	•	They note a slight uptick in total findings for Q4 but highlight a downward trend on a year-over-year basis.
	•	Findings are concentrated where model inventory is largest (e.g., Risk, Global Banking & Markets).
	•	Internal Audit (IA) observations:
	•	Seven IA findings were closed in the quarter, all of them lower-severity (general) items, primarily documentation-related.
	•	A new, low-severity IA finding was raised noting a “pattern” of validation documentation gaps over a few years. IA did not question the firm’s validation conclusions but felt it warranted a broader training initiative.
	•	The firm agreed to roll out training to reinforce comprehensive documentation standards by the end of April.

⸻

6. Board and FRAC-Level Metrics (RAS Utilization)
	•	The firm tracks several risk appetite statement (RAS) metrics around unvalidated or rejected models and the aging of those conditions.
	•	Waiver framework:
	•	If a model is in use without a finalized validation (unvalidated) or with a “reject” rating, it must have a time-bound waiver, typically remedied within 90 days.
	•	Age-based metrics (how long a model or finding remains unresolved past its original due date) are set to zero tolerance at nine months (now shortened to six months) at the FRAC level and one year at the Board level.
	•	Current usage:
	•	There were no Board-level or FRAC-level breaches during the quarter for unvalidated or rejected models.
	•	Some items did breach the age threshold for “severity 2” findings. Two specific GBM models triggered the FRAC threshold, but those findings have since been remediated.

⸻

7. Model Inventory and Ongoing Monitoring
	•	Inventory overview:
	•	The firm reports a stable overall model inventory, noting a modest increase of around 100 models over the past year.
	•	They break it down by tier (materiality) and business line (e.g., Risk Division, GBM, etc.).
	•	Market volatility considerations:
	•	Regulators ask whether the firm has enhanced monitoring due to recent market volatility (particularly interest-rate-related).
	•	The firm explains that its daily risk tests, ongoing performance assessments, and close scrutiny of code changes help identify potential breakage or model underperformance.
	•	As of now, there have been no major issues from volatile conditions.

⸻

8. Model Changes and Significant Revalidations
	•	Enhancements and new approvals:
	•	The firm highlights approvals for collateralized lending models (private equity, direct CRE, etc.), interest rate risk enhancements, and other operational models.
	•	Validation teams identified a few low-severity issues (e.g., minor code bugs) that were fixed pre-approval.
	•	Significant Tier 1 revalidation cycle:
	•	The two-year cycle for the highest-materiality (Tier 1) models concluded at year-end.
	•	No high-severity findings emerged; medium-severity findings primarily involved methodology, parameter calibration, or documentation improvements.
	•	The firm is already beginning the next two-year revalidation cycle for Tier 1 models and is also performing annual validations for CCAR/stress-testing models.

⸻

9. Meeting Conclusion
	•	The regulators express appreciation for the comprehensive materials and clarity of updates.
	•	They confirm they will follow up with any additional questions and will send an official acknowledgment of the firm’s supervisory response.
	•	Both parties end on a positive note, and the meeting concludes with thanks exchanged.

⸻

Overall, the discussion centers on the bank’s continued enhancements to model risk governance—tightening certain thresholds, validating and monitoring advanced AI models, and staying on top of internal audit findings. Regulators appear satisfied with the bank’s progress and reaffirm that they will remain in contact regarding any needed clarifications on model risk and supervisory items.

4. Detailed Updates and Discussion

4.1 Waiver Thresholds and Aging

The firm reiterated that it has a zero-tolerance policy at the Board Risk Committee (BRC) level for models or findings aged beyond one year from the original due date. As an intermediate check, the firm’s Model Risk Control Committee (FRAC) threshold was previously set at nine months. To better align with other control functions, the FRAC threshold has been shortened to six months. The firm explained that this adjustment creates an additional buffer, ensuring potential concerns are flagged and addressed before reaching the Board’s one-year threshold.

4.2 Generative AI (GAI) Models

The firm has observed an increase in the number of AI/ML models, including those using large language models (LLMs). While most uses remain low-risk and focused on operational efficiencies, the firm noted its first Tier 1 Generative AI model (ESGAI). The validation approach for GAI follows the firm’s existing model risk framework, supplemented by an AI Risk and Controls Committee. This committee includes representatives from legal, compliance, operational risk, and other control functions to address emerging risks such as data privacy, unintended model behaviors, and compliance considerations.

4.3 Internal Audit Findings

The firm reported that many of the recent internal audit findings were of lower severity, typically related to documentation enhancements. Internal audit had also identified a pattern of documentation inconsistencies over several years. The firm has responded by committing to additional training sessions on comprehensive model validation documentation. Most findings have already been remediated or are in the process of closure, with no impact on the fundamental integrity of any model conclusions.

4.4 Model Inventory and Revalidations

The firm’s model inventory remains relatively stable. A slight uptick in Q4 was attributed to normal development and enhancements in existing models. The firm tracks outstanding waivers carefully and ensures that no waiver is extended indefinitely without proper justification. Significant Tier 1 revalidations, required on a two-year cycle, have been completed for the current period with no high-severity findings. The firm is also in the midst of annual reviews tied to regulatory exercises such as CCAR. Overall, there have been no major performance issues in daily run tests, and no models have experienced unexpected breakage during recent market volatility.

⸻

5. Questions and Responses (in Third Person)
	1.	Regulators inquired about the rationale for tightening waiver thresholds
The firm responded that it sought to align its Model Risk processes with similar frameworks in other control functions (e.g., Internal Audit). By reducing the FRAC threshold from nine to six months, the firm provided additional time to address potential issues well before the Board’s one-year zero-tolerance deadline.
	2.	Regulators asked for an update on the firm’s progress with Generative AI
The firm explained that it continues to see new GAI applications, often focusing on operational efficiencies. It has validated its first Tier 1 GAI model (ESGAI) and uses AI-specific validation templates. The AI Risk and Controls Committee reviews AI models for potential legal, compliance, and operational risks that go beyond traditional model risk.
	3.	Regulators requested information on recent Internal Audit findings
The firm stated that the majority of new findings related to documentation gaps rather than fundamental model performance. Some issues had been self-identified in the course of prior reviews. To address these gaps, the firm is rolling out targeted training for validators, emphasizing thorough documentation standards.
	4.	Regulators inquired about model performance during market volatility
The firm reported that daily run tests remain stable. There have been no noteworthy breakages, code failures, or unusual parameter shifts resulting from market events. The firm also indicated it monitors changes in model code for any signs of stress or anomalies.
	5.	Regulators asked whether any unvalidated Tier 1 models had exceeded their remediation deadlines
The firm confirmed that all unvalidated or rejected models require waivers and are tracked for timeliness. Extended waivers are granted only after a robust internal process, and aging metrics (nine months previously, now six months) ensure issues are escalated before becoming overdue at the Board level.

⸻

6. Next Steps and Action Items
	•	Acknowledgment Letters:
Regulators plan to issue formal letters acknowledging the firm’s recent supervisory response.
	•	Severity 1 Finding Confirmation:
The firm will verify the status of a Severity 1 finding in the Risk division to confirm whether the model is in production or still under development.
	•	Documentation Training Completion:
The firm will finalize and conduct training sessions on validation documentation best practices by the end of April.
	•	Generative AI Oversight:
The firm will continue to provide updates on new GAI models and any significant policy or governance changes under the AI Risk and Controls Committee.
	•	Continued Market Monitoring:
Daily run tests will continue, with attention to volatility and potential code updates that might signal underlying stress.

⸻

7. Conclusion

Regulators expressed appreciation for the comprehensive update and noted that no significant concerns emerged from the quarterly materials. The firm will continue its proactive approach to model risk, especially around new AI applications and any documentation improvements suggested by internal audit. Both parties agreed to maintain open communication on model risk developments and to reconvene at the next scheduled quarterly update (or sooner if needed).

4. Detailed Discussion and Q&A

Below is a summary of questions raised during the meeting and the firm’s responses.

4.1 Changes to Waiver Thresholds
	•	Question (Regulator):
“You recently tightened the waiver aging threshold from nine months to six months. Could you provide background on why you lowered it and how it aligns with the board’s existing threshold?”
	•	Response (Firm):
“Previously, we introduced zero tolerance for waivers older than one year at the Board level. We had an internal (FRAC) threshold of nine months but decided to tighten that to six months for better alignment with other control functions (e.g., internal audit) and to ensure we have ample time to remediate before reaching Board-level thresholds. This gives the FRAC additional buffer to address potential issues before one year elapses.”

4.2 Generative AI (GAI) Model and Future Plans
	•	Question (Regulator):
“We noticed the ESGAI model was recently approved. It’s a large language model. Could you talk about your broader approach to Generative AI? Are you looking at many use cases? Any specific risk governance for GAI?”
	•	Response (Firm):
“Yes, ESGAI is our first Tier 1 GAI model. Most GAI uses here have been low-risk, operational-efficiency tools. All GAI models go through our existing model risk process with dedicated AI/ML validation templates. In addition, we’ve established an AI Risk and Controls Committee, which includes operational risk, legal, compliance, and other relevant control functions. This committee provides an additional oversight layer beyond standard model validation due to heightened concerns like data usage and privacy. We have indeed seen growth in AI models, but many are Tier 2 or Tier 3, and they must follow the same rigorous validation processes.”

4.3 Internal Audit Findings and Documentation
	•	Question (Regulator):
“You mentioned a few internal audit findings related to documentation. How is the firm addressing these gaps? Is there specific training for staff?”
	•	Response (Firm):
“Most findings identified by internal audit focused on documentation clarity, not on the validity of model outputs or effective challenge. We’ve already remedied several of these items. For the most recent one (raised in Q4), we are developing a formal training program for our validators to reinforce comprehensive documentation standards. Our target is to complete this training by the end of April.”

4.4 Model Inventory Trends
	•	Question (Regulator):
“Your inventory is generally stable, but there was a slight uptick in Q4. What drove that, and do you see any issues with timely validations?”
	•	Response (Firm):
“The small increase reflects typical new-model approvals and changes in existing models. We’re closely monitoring them through our waiver process. Each model requiring validation has a remediation timeline, and we track these carefully. We haven’t identified any major delays beyond standard extensions. Our aged metrics help ensure nothing languishes past the original due date.”

4.5 Market Volatility and Model Performance
	•	Question (Regulator):
“Given recent market volatility, have you enhanced your daily model monitoring processes? Notably, are any pricing or risk models showing stress or breakage?”
	•	Response (Firm):
“We conduct daily run tests, and so far, we haven’t seen any unusual breakage or unexpected parameter shifts. Our teams also proactively check for large market shocks. If we see unusual code changes or anomalies, that prompts deeper scrutiny. At this time, we’re not seeing significant performance issues.”

⸻

5. Action Items and Next Steps
	1.	Acknowledgment Letters:
	•	Regulators will send acknowledgement letters regarding the firm’s recent supervisory response.
	2.	Follow-Up on Severity 1 Model:
	•	The firm to confirm details regarding a Severity 1 finding in the Risk division (to clarify if the model was in use or in development).
	3.	Documentation Training:
	•	The firm to complete the new training program for validation staff by end of April.
	4.	Monitoring of Market Volatility:
	•	The firm will continue daily run tests and step up monitoring for any potential volatility-driven model errors or breakages.
	5.	Generative AI Governance:
	•	The firm to keep regulators informed of further developments, approvals, or changes in the GAI framework and usage.

⸻

6. Conclusion
	•	The regulators confirmed receipt of the quarterly update materials.
	•	The firm provided detailed updates on the model risk inventory, waiver threshold changes, and the status of internal audit findings.
	•	Generative AI governance remains a focus, with new oversight committees and processes in place.
	•	No immediate concerns were raised regarding market volatility or model performance.
	•	Both parties agreed to continue close communication and follow up on open items and training initiatives.

These minutes capture the primary points of discussion, key questions and responses, and agreed-upon next steps.






Below is a revised version you might find clearer and more concise:

Revised Response:

The CEU calculation is embedded within the Tier D1 SA-CCR DRC. In alignment with the Firmwide Standards for Deterministic Regulatory Calculations, MRM conducts an annual review of all Tier D1 DRCs to confirm their ongoing validity, considering potential changes to the DRC itself or the surrounding operating environment. In addition, Tier D1 DRC developers are required to obtain IRG approval for any DRC modifications before implementing them in production.

Furthermore, continuous monitoring procedures are in place to maintain the accuracy of the DRC. These procedures include daily regression tests and weekly ongoing monitoring reports to verify the CEU determination logic.

This version groups the key points more clearly, highlights responsibilities, and streamlines the language. You can adjust the level of detail or formality to suit your specific needs.





A new 1-month “staple-shaped” instantaneous forward rate (IFR) discontinuity for the USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) curve, which is based on 3-month SOFR International Money Market (IMM) futures, addresses short-end constraints and enables more granular control at the 1-month level.


A new “staple-shaped” IFR discontinuity—two offsetting jumps spaced one month apart—was introduced to the USD SOFR curve to address short-end constraints driven by 3-month SOFR IMM futures and CFR interpolation in IFR space, while preserving CER interpolation and enabling more granular 1-month control, specifically allowing the desk to manage 1-month serial SOFR/FF basis levels previously beyond their reach.

Below is a detailed, thematic summary of the conversation. It focuses on the main topics discussed, the context behind them, and the next steps or action items that arose.

1. Upcoming Meeting With Brian (Wednesday Morning)
	•	Schedule and Materials
	•	The speakers confirm that a meeting with Brian is still planned for Wednesday morning (referred to as “Wednesday 45”).
	•	They note that materials being circulated are updates that were originally prepared for a prior meeting which “got bumped.”
	•	Topics to Cover
	1.	Emery Remediation: Provide an update and refresh of the remediation bid, given schedule changes.
	2.	AI Topics:
	•	Growth and modality of AI resources (e.g., HPC usage).
	•	“AI acceleration proposal” and a related summary from “AI governance from table.”
	3.	Leslie’s Request:
	•	There is a question about integrating an ask from Leslie.
	•	The group is unclear on the background or context of Leslie’s query and wonders where it originated.
	•	This might be an opportunity to review the DAIS process for Brian, including divisional representation (e.g., Jay, Constantine).
	4.	Additional AI Initiatives:
	•	The team wants to get a comprehensive list of ongoing or potential AI ideas from Jay.
	•	They plan to be “opinionated”—assessing which ideas are more likely to succeed and which are less so, potentially identifying gaps or overlooked opportunities.
	•	They also discuss how success in production (e.g., an AI-driven validation or summarization tool) could reinvigorate interest.
	5.	Resources and Headcount:
	•	Part of the AI discussion centers on highlighting resource constraints, budget (ZPP), and headcount needs.
	•	They mention HPC usage charts, exponential growth, and how to represent (or exclude) certain large allocations (e.g., T204, AI platform) to make the data clearer.

2. Additional AI Updates and Observations
	•	Big Models / AI 2.0
	•	There are bank-wide efforts around large model initiatives.
	•	Upcoming pilot projects (e.g., “blockingination detection”) for GBM public vs. private.
	•	Positioning and Ownership
	•	Speakers note they want it clear that their team is spearheading AI efforts, rather than another department (OAS).
	•	They also mention synergy with AI HPC resources and that there’s ongoing work with other teams (e.g., “AirCC stuff”).

3. Other Agenda Items for Brian
	1.	IRR & CCAR
	•	They plan to refresh Brian on the status of IRR work and CCAR updates.
	2.	Lotus, RCSA, and Issue Management
	•	They have bullets to discuss, given Brian’s ongoing focus on RCSA (Risk and Control Self-Assessment) and issue management.
	•	One point is the milestone reached on some RCSA deliverables (control library sign-off, for instance).
	•	They need final confirmation on a control-library spreadsheet from compliance (“someone in compliance emailed a spreadsheet”).
	•	The group believes the changes align with prior agreements and likely just require official sign-off.

4. Metrics and Findings
	•	Current ‘No Breach’ Moment
	•	The team discusses how for certain key metrics, there are currently no active breaches.
	•	However, there may be potential upcoming breaches (e.g., a repo-related one).
	•	Tracking the Overall Findings Count
	•	They recall the count of open findings used to be quite high (possibly 40–50), and they are now aiming for a lower number (around 22).
	•	They see progress in some areas but mention continued friction in others (e.g., market risk consistently missing deadlines unless escalated).
	•	Possible Thematic Findings
	•	They are considering raising “thematic findings” for any group that remains in persistent metric “red” status.
	•	One idea is to pick a date (e.g., April 1) after which the team will systematically raise findings if certain metrics remain red, ensuring consistent application across GBM and other divisions.
	•	RCSA Integration
	•	Ongoing conversations about how the new RCSA processes (led by the central risk organization) align with day-to-day controls and findings management.
	•	There is mention of how risk teams only do RCSA events semiannually, making control-effectiveness updates slow.

5. “Breach Response Plan” and Workflow Tool
	•	New Policy Requirement
	•	A new policy mandates that any breach must have a response plan (with an ETA) approved by the CRO (Alex).
	•	The group references a “breach workflow tool” originally developed for Market Risk.
	•	Challenges
	•	The tool is not well-suited to ongoing or long-standing breaches (as often happens in this group’s processes, which can remain “over” for extended periods rather than a short event).
	•	Using the tool daily for repeated, unchanged breaches would be an administrative burden.
	•	Seeking Clarification
	•	They want clarity on how detailed Alex wants these response plans to be.
	•	They had initially thought an exemption might be possible, but it appears certain stakeholders (e.g., Motrum) insist on using the new tool regardless.
	•	Next Steps
	•	There is a follow-up call scheduled (moved to “tomorrow”) to discuss a possible exemption or a more streamlined process for these “long-running” or “operational” types of breaches.
	•	They note that other teams (like OpRisk) have similar issues, though some (like Phil’s group) appear to have already acquiesced.

6. Action Items & Points of Emphasis
	1.	AI Resource & Budget Discussion
	•	Finalize HPC usage charts, deciding whether to include or exclude large platform allocations, to clarify the growth story for Brian.
	•	Emphasize how the AI demands and expansions fit into the existing headcount and budget constraints (ZPP).
	2.	List of AI Initiatives
	•	Obtain the comprehensive list from Jay/Constantine.
	•	Formulate opinions on which projects have the highest chance of success or strategic value, plus mention any new opportunities not currently on that list.
	3.	Sign-off on Control Library
	•	Confirm agreement with the recent spreadsheet from compliance and provide official go-ahead.
	4.	Metrics Updates
	•	Refresh the table for Brian, highlight improvement trends, but also outline the areas (e.g., Market Risk) still needing regular escalation.
	5.	Thematic Findings Escalation
	•	Potentially propose a set start date (e.g., April 1) for systematic escalation via thematic findings when certain divisions remain in red status.
	6.	Breach Response Plan Tool
	•	Attend the follow-up meeting to see if an exemption or adapted process can be reached.
	•	Seek Brian’s input on the best approach to manage daily operational/long-term breaches under the new policy.

Overall Takeaways
	•	Preparation for Brian: The team plans to cover AI updates (including acceleration proposals, resource constraints), risk metrics (breaches, findings, and open issues), and RCSA progress.
	•	Administrative & Policy Burdens: New policy requirements (e.g., breach response tool) may be ill-suited to how this team typically manages longer-running issues, prompting them to seek alternatives or clarifications.
	•	Governance & Ownership: They want to highlight clearly where AI efforts truly sit (their team vs. other groups), underscore successes in HPC usage, and clarify budgetary needs.
	•	Ongoing Friction Points: Persistent challenges with market risk’s responsiveness to escalations and confusion over RCSA processes remain important discussion items for Brian’s input.

This summary reflects the key points and context from the transcript. It consolidates who is doing what, where the main pressures or problems lie, and which decisions or clarifications need leadership input.





A new “staple-shaped” IFR discontinuity—two offsetting jumps one month apart—was introduced to the USD SOFR curve to address short-end constraints and enable more granular 1-month-level control within each 3-month IMM period.



Below is a consolidated, detailed summary of the conversation. It organizes the main points and clarifies the various threads that came up during the discussion:

1. Purpose of the Conversation

The speakers are discussing a series of updates and action items related to:
	•	AI-related projects and communications
	•	MRA (Matter Requiring Attention) remediation status
	•	Upcoming meetings with different committees (BRC, FRAC)
	•	Governance and risk-related items (RCSAs, capital risk, expansions, etc.)
	•	Scheduling constraints, especially with one person being out on Tuesday

The conversation centers on making sure that final materials (particularly for BRC and FRAC) are up to date, reflect recent changes, and incorporate feedback from various stakeholders.

2. AI Updates and Communication
	1.	Polished Language / Revised Notes
	•	There are existing AI updates, some of which overlap with emails sent to Alex and Gopi. The idea is to “true up” or refine the wording to match a more polished version already in circulation.
	•	There are also notes from a meeting with Michaela and a governance roundtable (led by or involving Eric Goor) that should be incorporated into the AI section of broader governance or committee materials.
	2.	Continued Improvements in CCR and ASL
	•	The conversation touches on CCR (likely a risk or compliance model/tool) and ASL (possibly another internal system or tool). Both are undergoing continual enhancements. The group wants to decide if these ongoing improvements are significant enough to highlight in upcoming committee materials.
	•	The suggestion is to confirm with team members (e.g., Javarianna or Andresa) which specific enhancements might be noteworthy or relevant for the committees.

3. MRA Remediation Status
	1.	Background
	•	The MRA remediation appears to be a priority topic for multiple committees (BRC, FRAC).
	•	There were originally 19 total findings from some form of audit or review (by ERM or an external body), of which most have been remediated. Three remain open.
	2.	Committee Presentations
	•	The question arises whether MRA remediation should stand on its own as a separate discussion item, especially since some committees have specific agendas that may or may not align with MRA topics.
	•	There is a desire to keep the language very clear about what has been done so far (e.g., the 19 findings, how many were resolved, and the plan for the remaining open items).
	3.	Capital Risk Table Issue
	•	The speakers reference a table or chart that addresses “capitalist challenges” or “capital risk,” which might incorrectly lump MRA remediation into a broader risk discussion.
	•	There is a need to ensure that MRA items are accurately represented and not placed into a table that could suggest a mismatch of issues. One speaker references Kevin’s email, noting that bullet points about MRA have been removed from that particular risk table to avoid confusion.

4. Upcoming Meetings and Materials
	1.	Meeting Schedule
	•	A “stress meeting” is confirmed for Wednesday.
	•	Brian’s meeting is happening on Tuesday afternoon.
	•	The FRAC and BRC materials need to be prepared by Thursday and Friday, respectively, to align with upcoming sessions.
	2.	Committee Packets
	•	The final versions of FRA and BRC decks (or related material) should incorporate big topics: MRA remediation, significant AI updates, CCR/ASL enhancements, and any other noteworthy developments.
	•	There is interest in ensuring the committees receive clear, polished language that reflects current progress on these initiatives.
	3.	RCSAs (Risk & Control Self-Assessments)
	•	The Q4 RCSA results (at least for GBM) will need to be included in the upcoming committee updates or presentations. The speaker intends to finalize these results by Tuesday night to be ready for review on Wednesday.

5. Potential DRC Expansion
	•	There is mention of expanding something called “DRC” to EIA (the acronym is not fully defined in the conversation).
	•	Engineering teams would need to propose an onboarding plan and resource estimates.
	•	It does not appear to be budgeted for this year, so the timeline is still “to be determined” (TBD).

6. Action Items and Next Steps
	1.	Refining Documents
	•	Incorporate polished language from the “already circulated” AI updates, along with notes from Michaela’s meeting and Eric Goor’s governance roundtable.
	•	Clarify the MRA remediation language so that it properly captures the status of the open/closed findings.
	2.	Coordination with Various Stakeholders
	•	Check in with specific team members (e.g., Andresa, Javarianna) to see if the ongoing CCR/ASL upgrades warrant highlighting in committee materials.
	•	Coordinate with Kevin (and possibly others) to ensure MRA references are correctly presented or removed from any confusing risk tables.
	3.	Preparing for a Busy Week
	•	One person will be out on Tuesday, so they plan to work remotely or at night to finalize certain documents, especially the RCSA updates.
	•	Materials for BRC and FRAC should be ready by Thursday/Friday, noting that the MRA remediation will likely be a central topic.

7. Overall Takeaways
	•	Timely Updates: Multiple committees (BRC, FRAC) need accurate, up-to-date information on MRA remediation, AI/CCR/ASL enhancements, and RCSA results.
	•	Clear Communication: The transcript underscores how critical it is to fine-tune the language in presentations, especially around MRA findings and any risk tables, so that committees receive an accurate picture.
	•	Resource Planning: Some items, such as the DRC expansion, remain in a preliminary stage and need budget/resource alignment before proceeding.
	•	Logistics: Owing to schedules (someone being out Tuesday), final reviews will be done quickly—some on Tuesday night, with a final check on Wednesday morning, before the materials go to their respective committees.

In essence, the conversation is a coordination meeting to ensure that various corporate governance and risk materials—especially around MRA remediation and AI—are updated, aligned with stakeholder feedback, and ready in time for important committee sessions.





Below is a concise summary of what was discussed (and planned) for the upcoming Monday “PO” call based on the transcript:

Purpose of the Monday PO Call
	•	Gather and review any pressing regulatory items that need to be communicated or escalated.
	•	Check in on outstanding action items (e.g., T TBP cleanup, Fed submissions, etc.).

Main Discussion Topics
	1.	Regulatory Updates (SEC, FINRA, Fed)
	•	SEC AP Model Request:
	•	A minor submission item; no major concerns expected.
	•	Team will confirm details are finalized or if any clarifications are needed.
	•	FINRA Follow-ups:
	•	There may be outstanding follow-up items to communicate or confirm.
	•	Fed-Related Items:
	•	Briefly mention the upcoming CEU meeting with the Fed.
	•	The team will also touch on the submission of the latest inventory to the Fed (Ariana is handling details).
	2.	T TBP (Trade/Transaction Booking Policy) Cleanup
	•	The group wants to highlight the revamp of the T TBP process.
	•	Open Tickets: People with older booking policy exceptions need to review or close them.
	•	The call is a chance to remind owners of outstanding tickets to address them by a certain deadline.
	•	Follow-up Strategy:
	•	Phil (and possibly Prashant) will help chase updates from London-based or harder-to-reach teams.
	•	If no response is received from owners, tickets may be closed or escalated.
	3.	CCAR / General Fed-Submission Updates
	•	A short update on any CCAR-related progress or requirements if relevant.
	•	Mention if there are any regulatory due dates or deliverables in the next couple of weeks.
	4.	High-Level Reminders
	•	Governance Team Constraints: The governance team is understaffed at the moment (with Lena’s departure and someone else out sick), so be mindful of how much is assigned to them.
	•	Upcoming Committee Meetings: BRC and FRAC are on the same timeline (February 27). The call might briefly confirm any dependencies or next steps related to preparing materials.

Outcome / Next Steps for the PO Call
	•	Finalize which items to present: The group will decide which updates (SEC AP model, FINRA follow-ups, Fed inventory submission) need more attention on the call.
	•	Set a Deadline for T TBP Ticket Closures: Communicate a clear plan for owners to respond or close their tickets.
	•	Coordinate with Key Stakeholders: Ensure people like Ariana, Phil, Prashant, and others are looped in for their respective pieces of work.
	•	Confirm Prep for Regulatory Meetings: Decide if any additional materials or summaries are needed for the Fed or other regulators.

That covers the main points expected to be addressed in the next Monday PO call based on the conversation.





Below is a concise summary of the main points discussed in the transcript:
	1.	Lotus Data Source Changes
	•	There is a plan to move certain Lotus-related calculations from existing (“non-alternative”) data sources to a new, presumably higher-quality data source.
	•	The team expects fewer manual overrides and improved data quality once these new sources are implemented.
	•	Follow-up reviews may be required after the switch, but the team will perform checks to ensure the transition does not worsen data quality.
	2.	Expansion of LCO (Europe Scope)
	•	There is discussion about expanding LCO coverage in Europe.
	•	This expansion was not previously budgeted, so the team needs to determine resource requirements, timeline, and headcount.
	•	Further planning with senior stakeholders (e.g., “BB”) is needed to clarify scope and funding.
	3.	UK’s Stance on Basel 3 and Resulting Budget/Planning Implications
	•	The UK has decided not to proceed with full Basel 3 implementation.
	•	This decision impacts prior plans, budgets, and potentially the technical approach to regulatory calculations.
	•	The team notes that any rework (e.g., rewriting certain calculations) could be as large an undertaking as the initial DRC (Default Risk Charge) build.
	•	They emphasize the need for a strategic discussion on how to manage the additional workload and align resources accordingly.

Overall, the conversation centers on upcoming data-source transitions, regulatory scope expansion in Europe, and the budget/timeline adjustments required in light of the UK’s Basel 3 decision.



Below is a concise summary of the main points and discussion threads in the transcript:
	1.	Upcoming Meeting With Brian (Monday)
	•	The speakers are planning to update Brian on several topics, including AI guardrails (previously discussed), final adjustments to the ETSC framework, and an introduction of a “pro reject” approach and systematic consumer testing.
	•	They also want to bundle together updates around MRM, ETSC, and ETP commitments to provide a cohesive “end state” picture.
	2.	AI Topics & T/Risk Coordination
	•	There is friction regarding how T/Risk and second-line teams process reviews and the perception that second-line processes are slowing down AI initiatives.
	•	T/Risk appears to be deferring some steps or waiting until after MRM reviews to avoid repetitive rework.
	•	The team notes that developers (and others) sometimes blame risk/control functions for delays, but emphasize that T/Risk is independent and has its own process.
	•	The group considers having a direct conversation with T/Risk (possibly with “Car”) to clarify procedures and reduce miscommunication—ideally in person rather than via email.
	3.	New Detection Model for T2
	•	There is a mention of a new AI-related detection model with shorter latency (around one second).
	•	The plan is to pilot it for bankers and eventually expand it for GS or broader usage.
	•	It would be “preventative” rather than “detective,” checking documents in real time.
	4.	Transformer Model for Short-Term Trading Signals
	•	A separate team is building a transformer-based model to generate trading signals over very short windows (e.g., ten seconds).
	•	Discussion centers on how MRM or second-line could effectively validate or test these kinds of real-time models, which can be challenging with fast market data.
	•	There is a question of whether this transformer approach qualifies as “GI/AI” given it is presumably much smaller scale than large language models (LLMs).
	5.	Buyback Trade and MMLat Update
	•	Brief reference to a new client-related buyback trade (about 500 million EUR) with some discontinuities in payoff.
	•	Possible plan to mention this to Brian if relevant, though it may be more detail than he needs.
	6.	FRAC Breaches and New Workflow Tool
	•	They discuss persistent FRAC (Framework for Risk Appetite Compliance) breaches and the firm’s protocol for addressing them (e.g., obtaining new committed dates, root-cause explanations).
	•	A new “breach action plan protocol” and workflow tool from risk engineering might soon be mandatory.
	•	Concern is raised that this new process was built primarily with market risk in mind and might be too cumbersome or less relevant for non-financial risk.
	•	They note it will require some scrutiny to ensure it makes sense for their specific use cases before they adopt it.
	7.	Regulatory Exam (Michaela / Next Steps)
	•	The team wants clarity on how aggressively to respond to exam feedback from regulators.
	•	They sense the regulatory examination team might be split: some think the current approach is adequate, others believe more thorough documentation is required.
	•	They plan to see if they can glean more information informally during upcoming meetings (e.g., an MRM “conclave”).
	•	They also discuss whether scheduling time directly with Michaela after some internal alignment might be beneficial.
	8.	General Approach & Next Steps
	•	The speakers plan to provide Brian with a summary of all these points: AI guardrails, ETSC framework, T/Risk coordination, FRAC breaches, CCR updates, and possible buyback trade updates.
	•	They will also flag any overhead or headcount concerns if new processes (e.g., the FRAC workflow tool) become mandatory.
	•	They consider setting up a timeline for year-end tasks (e.g., internal sign-offs, next regulatory discussions) and ensure they coordinate well with leadership and exam teams.

Overall, the conversation focuses on preparing for an upcoming leadership update (with Brian), addressing AI model governance (especially T/Risk interactions), dealing with repeated FRAC breaches, and strategizing regulatory engagements and next steps.












Summary of the Meeting
	1.	Overall Exam Objective and Process
	•	The Federal Reserve exam focused on assessing the firm’s Model Risk Management (MRM) framework and practices, including governance, model development, model validation, and ongoing monitoring procedures.
	•	The examiners conducted transaction testing to evaluate how well the firm executes its MRM procedures in practice.
	•	The exam occurred virtually between September 20, 2024, and November 15, 2024.
	2.	Key Conclusion: Generally Satisfactory but One MRA Issued
	•	Examiners concluded that most components of the firm’s MRM framework are “generally satisfactory.”
	•	However, the exam identified a control deficiency in the validation framework for “in-use” models. This deficiency may impede the firm’s ability to confirm that models remain appropriately calibrated and fit for purpose over time.
	•	As a result, an MRA (Matter Requiring Attention) is being issued regarding weaknesses in the model validation controls framework.
	3.	Details of the MRA
	•	Deficiency in Qualitative Assessments: Although the firm uses both qualitative and quantitative tools to assess model performance, there is insufficient documentation or substantiation for qualitative assessments, except in cases that trigger additional validation or remediation.
	•	Limited Evidence of Qualitative Reviews: During quarterly and annual reviews, examiners saw little evidence that qualitative assessments had actually been performed or documented.
	•	Infrequent Revalidations: A significant proportion of models have not been revalidated over recent years, raising safety and soundness concerns—particularly for higher-risk models that are not automatically subject to periodic revalidation.
	•	Remediation Required by December 31, 2025: The firm must enhance its MRM practices so that both quantitative and qualitative assessments are adequately and consistently supported, especially in quarterly/annual reviews for higher-risk models.
	4.	Clarifications on Revalidation Frequency
	•	The Federal Reserve does not mandate specific revalidation intervals in the guidance. However, the examiners emphasized the importance of confirming that models remain fit for purpose on a regular basis.
	•	The MRA focuses on ensuring ongoing, evidence-based checks rather than dictating a particular revalidation schedule.
	5.	Observations on the Apple Card CECL Model (Model 2381)
	•	While these issues are not new findings (they were already noted in a previous ACL exam), examiners reiterated concerns regarding:
	1.	Model Development: Issues in regression inputs, regression-output evaluation, and insufficient model-fit testing.
	2.	Model Documentation: Limitations and compensating controls were not prominently highlighted, and documentation did not meet MRM standards.
	3.	Model Validation: Validators did not sufficiently justify use of the same approach for Apple Card and the Apple Card monthly installment product. Excessive use of time dummy variables raised concerns about overfitting, which was not challenged by validators.
	4.	Ongoing Monitoring: Thresholds are set such that red performance is only triggered if both the Apple Card model and an alternative model underperform—this dependency might mask issues.
	•	Supervisory findings related to this model remain open from the previous ACL exam, so no new formal findings are being issued here. However, the examiners encouraged continued remediation and deeper engagement if needed.
	6.	Next Steps
	•	The firm plans to review the final exam letter in detail and then discuss with the Federal Reserve examiners how best to address the MRA.
	•	Examiners will continue quarterly monitoring; during these updates, the firm can raise any questions about the MRA or other related issues.

Overall, the meeting emphasized the importance of comprehensive and well-documented qualitative assessments, alongside quantitative monitoring, to ensure all models in use remain appropriately calibrated and truly fit for their intended purpose—particularly in rapidly changing market or business environments.






Below is a structured, detailed summary of the conversation. It reflects the key points, the context surrounding each, and the follow-up actions or concerns raised during the discussion.

1. Upcoming Meeting with Brian (MRM Exit Meeting)
	•	Schedule Confirmation: There is an MRM (Model Risk Management) exit meeting planned with Brian on Monday (or possibly Tuesday).
	•	Agenda Items:
	•	Regulatory Updates: The team wants to finalize and present various regulatory updates, including Basel-related developments and some second collateral allocator issues.
	•	AI Updates:
	•	Recent internal “guardrail” approvals.
	•	Governance process changes for AI usage.
	•	Overview of AI initiatives in production and a forward-looking view (next quarter or two).

2. AI Initiatives and Business Use Cases
	•	Large Language Models (LLMs): There is a mention of a “long list” of large LLM-based tools that will impact more models soon.
	•	Generative BI (Business Intelligence): Discussion of projects integrating generative AI for reporting and decision support.
	•	Project Mentions:
	•	“TBMs, the strocking with lia project piano” (the details are somewhat unclear, but these appear to be internal code names or project references).
	•	A “phase two” rollout is coming soon, possibly for a next-stage AI or machine-learning tool.
	•	User Feedback:
	•	The group wants someone unbiased (e.g., Erica or Wesley) to provide feedback on AI’s accuracy and utility.
	•	Current AI accuracy is reported at 91%, which they note is often better than what humans achieve—though there’s some question about the thoroughness of the resources supporting it.

3. Discussion on Electronic Trading & Market Conduct
	•	Market Conduct Rules: Brief mention of “market conduct for ETPs” (Exchange-Traded Products) and possible inclusion in the upcoming Brian meeting agenda.
	•	CBA Switch / Puzzle 3: There is a mention of a “puzzle for CBA switch,” though the relevance to the meeting’s main agenda is uncertain. It might be included in broader regulatory updates (e.g., “Basel 3,” European submission).

4. Regulatory / Basel 3 Updates
	•	Follow-Up for Brian: They want to combine recent updates on Basel 3 and other European regulatory changes into one summary for Brian.
	•	Addressing Brian’s Questions: There were questions posed by Brian previously (possibly about Basel or capital adequacy), and the team intends to provide a verbal update or bullet points clarifying those.

5. Second Collateral Allocator Issue
	•	Year-End Material Issues:
	•	There were multiple DRC (Default Risk Charge) and SOKR (possibly “Securities or Collateral” references) issues discovered before year-end.
	•	A new “bill” was posted, but the conversation implies that some details might still be unresolved.
	•	Open Points: The team is trying to recall specifics and ensure Brian is updated on these items if they are significant.

6. Metrics & Remediation Progress
	•	ATLC Findings:
	•	Initially quite high (21 issues), reduced to 14, but further progress has been slow or complicated by new items.
	•	Term Structure / “Tier One Age” Findings:
	•	Talk of metrics going from 54 down to around 20-something. The official numbers are stale (from November) and likely improved by year-end.
	•	GBM Findings:
	•	Not as much progress as hoped. Internal push is needed since the front office is apparently comfortable breaching “track” but not “work” (i.e., not meeting internal deadlines but not necessarily failing official regulatory deadlines).
	•	The team wants to escalate this reluctance to Brian and/or Alex to enforce accountability.

7. Communication & Escalation Strategy
	•	Follow-Up with GBM:
	•	The group has trouble getting consistent updates from GBM on remediation.
	•	Leadership in GBM told staff it is fine to breach the internal trackers (frack?), just not the official regulatory ones—a stance the MRM/validation team finds unacceptable.
	•	Involving Senior Leadership:
	•	Alex and Brian may intervene directly (e.g., phone calls) to reiterate the importance of meeting internal timelines and obligations, not just external regulatory ones.
	•	Maintaining “Statute”:
	•	The MRM team wants to keep up pressure and avoid undermining their own authority. They plan to phrase remediation deadlines as mandatory rather than negotiable.

8. Market & Trading-Book Observations
	•	Discount Curve Steepening:
	•	Nearly 200 basis point difference between lower short-term rates and the 10-year, while the Fed has cut rates 75 bps.
	•	The team wonders if there are notable trades or modeling issues tied to this rate environment.
	•	Risk Limits and VAR:
	•	In GTM space, the desk is apparently long USD 2.7 billion, but net risk is offset or “carnations inside,” so the VAR isn’t drastically affected. The group wants color on the rationale behind these positions.

9. Additional Model-Related Items
	•	CCAR Scenario & Narratives:
	•	Some new or ongoing approach to running the CCAR scenario with narrative explanation.
	•	The governance around these new modeling efforts is still being documented.
	•	“Canal” Ambitious Model:
	•	Possibly focusing on hedge funds or natural resources counterparties.
	•	There’s some confusion over classification by counterparty (natural resources) vs. classification by risk factor.

10. Final Preparations & Next Steps
	•	Meeting with Alex (Friday):
	•	The team plans to brief Alex or run certain items by him before bringing them up with Brian.
	•	There may be “red items” or urgent topics to discuss, but details are limited.
	•	Action Items:
	1.	Regulatory/AI/Model Updates: Finalize bullet points for Brian.
	2.	Finalize Basel 3 Follow-Up: Combine into a single document/summary.
	3.	Escalation on GBM Findings: Provide specific examples and names if needed so Alex/Brian can intervene.
	4.	Check on Market Risk Positions: Look into the discount curve steepening trades and how the bank is positioned.
	5.	Continue Gathering User Feedback on AI Tools: Identify an unbiased user champion (e.g., Erica, Wesley).

Overall Takeaway

The conversation revolves around preparing a thorough update for senior management (notably Brian, possibly Alex) covering:
	1.	Regulatory developments and outstanding remediation items (particularly around Basel 3 and the year-end findings).
	2.	AI initiatives and governance (accuracy rates, use cases, next-phase deployments).
	3.	Internal compliance challenges (GBM’s reluctance to meet MRM internal timelines).
	4.	Market insights (steepening rate curves, large positional bets).

The team is focused on ensuring a clear, consolidated message for Brian’s meeting, spotlighting progress, risks, and necessary escalations for effective remediation and accountability across business units.









Summary of the Transcript

The transcript outlines various updates and discussions on model risk management (MRM), remediation timelines, validation processes, and upcoming regulatory exams. Below is a summarized version of the key points:

1. Model Submissions and Remediation Timelines:
	•	Abilitiesization and Launch Timeline: The project has started but is not fully on track; the deadline is March.
	•	Prime Model BCD Review: Due by the end of January, focusing on outcomes analysis and implementation. Challenges are manageable, and findings will likely be combined with GSSEV validation (due mid-February).
	•	MR Remediation: Several findings with staggered timelines:
	•	Fed-raised issues require resolution by March.
	•	Sequencing steps involve December, February, and March milestones.
	•	Risk of findings remaining open for MR submission, though efforts are being made to avoid this.

2. Backtesting:
	•	Implementation has been received and is under review.
	•	Milestones for thresholds and frameworks are delayed until March.
	•	High-level testing is ongoing; main flaws may lie in the implementation phase.

3. Model Group and Gap Analysis:
	•	Reviews are on track, including:
	•	Theta model gaps (targeting 2025).
	•	Non-parallel scenarios (pending timeline adjustments after December 24th communication).

4. Calibrations and Monitoring:
	•	A decision on full model recalibration versus annual reassessment is pending, with recalibration likely, potentially resolving findings.
	•	New scenarios and metrics are being developed for cross-currency bases and sensitivity analysis.
	•	Frameworks for identifying key assumptions in sensitivity analysis are being finalized.

5. Exams and Exercises:
	•	ILST Exam: Materials are due by January 15th, with the exam in March. Key focus areas include governance, IT data, modeling documentation, and ongoing monitoring.
	•	BAU LGD Exercise: Scope is broad, including dependencies like FLR models, with a focus on inventory findings and validation logs.

6. General Risks and Concerns:
	•	Several findings are delayed, but efforts are being made to manage risks and ensure compliance with deadlines.
	•	Scope creep in certain exercises (e.g., BAU LGD) may require additional clarification and resource management.

Overall, the discussion reflects ongoing progress with manageable delays, a focus on implementation reviews, and preparations for regulatory exams and validations.












Below is a more detailed explanation of the DRC (sometimes referred to as “Decentralized Risk Categories” or similarly named regulatory/capital calculations) discussion and how they can be categorized, based on the transcript. The ultimate goal is to provide clarity on which DRC items fall under current policy scope (U.S. capital), which apply to specific non-U.S. legal entities, and which may fall outside capital rules altogether (e.g., liquidity requirements).

Why Categorize DRCs?

In the transcript, there was a concern that “DRCs” appear in multiple contexts—some are for U.S. capital calculations, some apply to foreign legal entities, and some may be tied to other regulations beyond capital (like liquidity or resolution planning). The team needs a systematic way to track each DRC so they can:
	1.	Explain the current state: Which DRCs are already covered by policy?
	2.	Identify gaps: Where do we lack clarity on coverage (e.g., newly discovered DRC items for non-U.S. entities)?
	3.	Plan next steps: Decide what to uplift, what to address later, and how to handle DRCs outside the “official” policy scope.

Three-Tier Categorization Approach

A straightforward approach is to create separate sections or tables that group DRCs by their applicability and underlying regulation:
	1.	Table A: U.S. Capital (Current Policy Scope)
	•	What’s included: All DRCs that fall under existing U.S. regulatory capital rules (Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC).
	•	Subsections:
	•	Already Uplifted: DRCs that have been identified and fully addressed in policies/procedures.
	•	Pending Prioritization: DRCs recognized as in-scope for U.S. capital but not yet remediated or prioritized.
	•	In Development: Future changes (e.g., Basel 3 Endgame, FRTB) that will require new or updated DRCs.
	2.	Table B: Non-U.S. Legal Entities
	•	What’s included: DRCs that apply to legal entities beyond the U.S. scope, such as GSI (in the UK), GSIB, GSPE, or more specialized entities (e.g., GSJC for real estate).
	•	Goal: Clarify whether each DRC is (or should be) covered under your firm’s global capital policy, or if it’s governed by local rules (e.g., PRA in the UK, ECB for EU entities).
	•	Format: For each legal entity, list:
	•	DRC Name
	•	Purpose (e.g., local regulatory capital requirement, local liquidity coverage, resolution planning)
	•	Governing Regulator
	•	Current Status (covered in existing policy or not)
	3.	Table C: Non-Capital Requirements (Liquidity, Resolution Planning, etc.)
	•	What’s included: DRC items that are not strictly capital-related but may be risk or regulatory-driven, such as LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio), resolution planning, or other reporting requirements.
	•	Key Question: Are these truly DRCs (in the sense of capital/risk models), or are they something else (like a purely operational or accounting reserve)? If they’re capital-like items, do they fall under any existing policy or do they need a new governance path?

Sample Breakdown of Each Category

Here is a simplified illustration of how you might lay out the tables. (The exact content and naming conventions would depend on your firm’s taxonomy.)

Table A: U.S. Capital

DRC Name	Regulatory Source	Policy Status	Next Steps
DRC 1 – US Fed	Federal Reserve	Uplifted in 2023	Periodic review in Q1 2024
DRC 2 – FDIC Rule	FDIC (US)	Pending Prioritization	Finalize by Q2 2024
DRC 3 – Basel 3E	US Implementation	In Development	Monitor upcoming Basel 3 Endgame framework

Table B: Non-U.S. Legal Entities

Legal Entity	DRC Name	Regulator	Included in Policy?	Notes
GSI (UK)	DRC 4 – PRA Capital	PRA/BoE (UK)	Not in current US scope	Potential alignment with group-level capital policy
GSJC (Real Estate)	DRC 5 – FDIC Reserve?	FDIC? or Local Reg?	Unclear (entity-specific)	Needs further confirmation from Controllers or Tiago
GSIB (Int’l)	DRC 6 – EBA?	European Regulators	Not in current US scope	Evaluate if it belongs to a group-wide policy extension

Table C: Non-Capital Requirements

Requirement	DRC or Similar	Regulatory Driver	Policy / Governance
Liquidity Coverage (LCR)	LCR DRC?	Federal Reserve / Basel	Potentially outside capital policy
Resolution Planning	-	FDIC / Fed – Title I	Separate resolution planning processes
Other Reporting	-	Varies (ECB, PRA, etc.)	Not capital-related; governance unclear

Key Points from the Transcript
	1.	Clarify Missing or “Random” DRCs
	•	Some DRCs appear to be for very narrow applications (e.g., a real estate entity’s reserve calculation).
	•	Verify with Controllers (or relevant owners) whether these items belong in your consolidated capital/risk policy scope.
	2.	Understand the Regulatory Source
	•	FDIC might apply to certain U.S. entities, PRA/BoE for UK entities, ECB/EBA for EU, etc.
	•	If the DRC is truly U.S. capital-related, it should already be in scope (or at least flagged for inclusion). If it’s missing, you need to determine why.
	3.	Push for a Unified View
	•	The conversation suggests you can rely on Tiago or a Controllers resource to collect and confirm the correct universe of DRCs.
	•	Once you have that list, present it in a coherent structure (e.g., the three tables above).
	4.	Ultimate Purpose
	•	Make it easy for senior management (e.g., Brian, Alex) to decide which items need urgent uplifting, which can wait, and how to expand policy scope if needed.

Action Items to Finalize DRC Categorization
	1.	Gather Detailed Inventory
	•	Work with Controllers, Finance, and other first-line teams to get the complete list of DRC items (both U.S. and non-U.S.).
	2.	Identify the Regulator & Entity
	•	For each DRC, confirm if it’s governed by Fed, FDIC, PRA, ECB, or another body.
	3.	Determine Policy Inclusion
	•	Check whether each DRC is already covered in the current U.S. capital policy.
	•	If not, decide whether to include it in a future global policy update or treat it separately.
	4.	Draft the Tables
	•	Create the “3-Table” framework (U.S. Capital, Non-U.S. Entities, Non-Capital Requirements) and populate with the data.
	5.	Review & Approval
	•	Present to management (e.g., Brian/Alex) for alignment on next steps, prioritization, or expansions of the policy scope.

Final Thoughts

The DRC categorization is intended to give you a clear roadmap of which rules belong where, who oversees them, and how they relate to your existing policies. By separating U.S. capital items from non-U.S. legal entities and non-capital items, you gain a straightforward, “bite-sized” view of a potentially complex web of regulatory requirements.
